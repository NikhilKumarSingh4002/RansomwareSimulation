# Ransomware Basic Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains a basic simulation of a ransomware application that demonstrates the fundamental concept of ransomware. The application adds a specific file extension and uses a simple string reversal algorithm as the encryption method. This project is intended for educational purposes only.

## Features

- **File Extension Modification**: Adds a custom file extension to files in the target directory.
- **String Reversal Encryption**: Implements a basic encryption algorithm by reversing the string of the file content.
- **Simulation**: Mimics the behavior of ransomware without causing any harm to the system or data.

## Warning

**This is a simulation only. Do not use this code on real systems or for malicious purposes. Misuse of this code could lead to legal consequences.**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Any required libraries (if applicable)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ransomware-basic-simulation.git
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python -u "amalware.py"
   ```

## Code Explanation

- **`amalware.py`**: The main script that performs the ransomware simulation.
- **`encryption_algo` function**: Implements the string reversal encryption algorithm.
